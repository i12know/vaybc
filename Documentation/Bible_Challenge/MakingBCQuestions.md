### Basic Rules:

1. Questions, answers, and biblical references must be within the character limits: questions under 200 characters, answers under 90 characters, and biblical references under 10 characters using abbreviations.
2. Use the ESV translation for all Bible text.
3. Keep the verbiage at an 11th-grade reading level and start the question with interrogative words: what, when, where, who, which, how, why, etc., if possible.
4. Each question should be directly related to a topic, but avoid using the topic word in the question itself.
5. Questions must be specific. Where possible, the question should use a word or phrase from the verbatim text of the Biblical reference, making the answer "irrefutable". But avoid mentioning the Biblical reference in the question.
6. Prefix the question with "(X-part)" if a question requires a multiple-part answer.
7. Output the trivia items in a table format, displayed in a codebox, without the header row. The format for each trivia item should be: Difficulty Level, Question, Answer, Reference, Notes on irrefutability and difficulty if needed, and the verbatim quote of the Bible Reference. All lines are sorted by Difficulty Level. Do not display empty lines after each trivia item.


### Irrefutable Question

An "**irrefutable question**" is the gold standard and it ensures the integrity of for the Bible Challenge competition. It is a self-contained intellectual puzzle where the path to the single, correct answer is demonstrably and exclusively found within the agreed-upon source text.

Its construction is like a legal case presented to a jury of experts: the question is the charge, the text is the evidence, and the answer is the only possible verdict. It must be able to withstand intense scrutiny without revealing any ambiguity, error, or reliance on information outside the established rules.

An irrefutable question stands on five pillars:

#### 1. A Single, Provable Answer

There is one and only one correct answer. The question is specifically engineered to eliminate all other valid alternatives.

-   **Refutable:** "Name a disciple Jesus loved." (Could be John, Lazarus, Peter, etc.)
    
-   **Irrefutable:** "Which disciple is explicitly identified with the title, 'the disciple whom Jesus loved'?" (Only John.)
    

#### 2. Textually Explicit Grounding

The answer is not based on interpretation, theological inference, or scholarly debate. It is explicitly stated in the words of the verbatim text. The question tests observation and synthesis, not opinion.

-   **Refutable:** "What is the most important lesson from the Parable of the Prodigal Son?" (This requires interpretation.)
    
-   **Irrefutable:** "(3-part answers) In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, what actions did the father take when he saw his son returning from a distance?" (The text explicitly says, "he felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.")

-   **Irrefutable Answer:** "The father ran, embraced, and kissed the son"
    

#### 3. Unambiguous and Precise Language

The wording of the question is surgical. Every word is chosen to eliminate loopholes and guide the contestant to the specific piece of information being tested. It avoids vague terms in favor of precise ones.

-   **Refutable:** "What happened when Jesus went to the Temple?" (Vague; happened many times.)
    
-   **Irrefutable:** "According to John, what was Jesus's first recorded action immediately after cleansing the Temple?" (It directs them to a specific Gospel account and a specific time, leading to the dialogue about destroying and raising the temple.)
    

#### 4. A Verifiable and True Premise

The question itself must be factually correct according to the source text. It cannot contain a hidden error that would invalidate the entire query.

-   **Refutable:** "When the Apostle Paul healed the blind man at Jericho..." (The premise is false; it was Jesus, not Paul.)
    
-   **Irrefutable:** "When Jesus healed the blind man, Bartimaeus,..." (The premise is true and sets a solid foundation.)
    

#### 5. Resistance to "Well, Actually..."

This is the ultimate test. An irrefutable question is designed to anticipate and neutralize the pedantic corrections that experts love to make. It closes loopholes before they can be exploited. This is often achieved by adding qualifiers like:

-   "According to what Jesus said..."
    
-   "Which author exclusively records..."
    
-   "What was the first thing he did..."
    
-   "Besides Peter, who else..."
    

In essence, an **irrefutable question** respects the expert by acknowledging their deep knowledge, but it challenges them by testing the structure, precision, and interconnectedness of that knowledge, rather than just the isolated facts themselves. When the answer is revealed, the correct response from a contestant should be a nod of respect, not a cry of foul play.

### Guideline for Assigning Point Values

A well-calibrated scoring system is what separates a good trivia game from a great one. It rewards knowledge appropriately by the *type* of thinking required for each question. This rubric is based on two main factors: the **obscurity** of the knowledge, and the **cognitive load** required to answer the questionâ€”moving from simple recall to multi-step logical inference.

Of course. Here is a comprehensive guideline drafted in Markdown format. It is designed to be given to an LLM to assist in the creation and scoring of irrefutable Bible trivia questions, incorporating all the principles we have discussed.

### Guideline to Determine Difficulty Values for Bible Trivia Jeopardy Games

#### 1. Foundational Principles

This document provides a rubric for assigning difficulty values (point scores) to Bible trivia questions. All questions must adhere to the following foundational principles:

*   **Source Text:** The English Standard Version (ESV) is the exclusive source text.
*   **Textual Corpus:** The content is drawn from the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) treated as a single chronological narrative (per a harmony like Thomas & Gundry's), and the book of Leviticus.
*   **Question Standard:** All questions must conform to the **"Irrefutable Question"** framework, meaning they are textually explicit, unambiguous, have a single provable answer, and possess a true premise.

The goal of scoring is to accurately reflect the **Cognitive Load** (the mental effort required to answer) and the **Knowledge Domain** (the relative obscurity of the source material).

#### 2. Core Scoring Concepts

Difficulty is determined by two main factors:

*   **Cognitive Load:** The type of thinking required. This ranges from:
    1.  **Direct Recall:** Retrieving a single, explicitly stated fact.
    2.  **Constrained Recall:** Filtering facts based on a specific condition (e.g., "first," "only," "besides").
    3.  **Synthesis:** Connecting multiple pieces of information within a passage or across texts.

*   **Knowledge Domain:** The familiarity of the content. This ranges from:
    1.  **Cornerstone:** Major events (Birth, Crucifixion), A-list characters (Jesus, the Twelve, Mary), and famous parables (Good Samaritan).
    2.  **Secondary:** Less-famous parables/miracles, secondary characters (Nicodemus, Zacchaeus), or specific details in major stories.
    3.  **Expert/Obscure:** Levitical law, genealogies, minor characters mentioned once (Malchus), names in lists, or textual differences between Gospel accounts.

#### 3. The Scoring Rubric

##### Single Jeopardy Round (100 - 500 Points)

This round focuses on foundational and detailed knowledge, primarily testing recall.

*   **100 Points: Foundational Recall**
    *   **Task:** Direct recall of a cornerstone fact about a top-tier character or event.
    *   **Example:** Identifying Peter as the one who made the "Son of the living God" confession.

*   **200 Points: Direct Recall**
    *   **Task:** Direct recall of a key fact, quote, or character from a major story that isn't a cornerstone event.
    *   **Example:** Naming the item the foolish virgins lacked (oil); identifying Judas Iscariot's famous quotes.

*   **300 Points: Specific Detail Recall**
    *   **Task:** Recalling a specific, less-obvious detail from within a major story or a key fact from a secondary story.
    *   **Example:** Identifying the type of tree Zacchaeus climbed; naming the beggar Bartimaeus.

*   **400 Points: Constrained or Secondary Recall**
    *   **Task:** Answering a question that requires a simple filter ("What was the *first* thing...") or recalling a key detail about a secondary character or less-famous parable.
    *   **Example:** Naming the father who stayed behind when his sons followed Jesus (Zebedee); identifying the fishermen's action with the good fish in the Parable of the Net.

*   **500 Points: Simple Synthesis or Chronology**
    *   **Task:** Connecting two closely related ideas within a passage OR chronologically ordering 3-4 major, well-known events.
    *   **Example:** Stating that a scribe was "not far from the kingdom" *because* of his wise answer; ordering the events of the Passion Week.

##### Double Jeopardy Round (200 - 1000 Points)

This round increases the difficulty by focusing on deeper knowledge, expert domains, and more complex synthesis. The point values of Single Jeopardy categories are doubled, and new, harder categories are introduced.

*   **200 & 400 Points:**
    *   **Task:** These values typically represent the doubled-value equivalent of the 100 and 200-point questions from the Single Jeopardy round. They serve as the entry-level questions for this harder round.

*   **600 Points: Moderate Synthesis or Precision Recall**
    *   **Task:** Connecting a Gospel event to its direct OT source (e.g., Jesus quoting Isaiah), recalling the specifics of a relationship (e.g., Annas and Caiaphas), or recalling a fact that requires precision to avoid a common error (e.g., BOTH Mary and Martha said...).
    *   **Example:** Identifying Moses' bronze serpent as the object Jesus compared himself to being "lifted up."

*   **800 Points: Multi-Part or Expert Recall**
    *   **Task:** Answering a 2- or 3-part question about a major story OR recalling a single, specific fact from an expert domain (e.g., Leviticus, a minor character, a political detail).
    *   **Example:** Listing the three things Jesus commanded the leper to do; naming the regions under Philip's jurisdiction.

*   **1000 Points: High-Level Synthesis or Obscurity**
    *   **Task:** Answering a multi-part question from an obscure text OR connecting scattered information across different chapters or even Testaments.
    *   **Example:** Naming the two events where God speaks the same line from Isaiah in Matthew; answering a 2-part question from the Levitical code.

##### Final Jeopardy (1100 Points)

*   **Task: Elite Synthesis**
    *   **Description:** These questions require a holistic command of the text. The answer is often a single, precise fact, but finding it requires connecting information about a minor character's appearances in different contexts or identifying a specific verse reference for a non-cornerstone event or quote.
    *   **Example:** Identifying Joanna by connecting her role as a financial supporter (Luke 8) with her role as a resurrection witness (Luke 24); asking for the verse where people wondered if Jesus would come to the festival at all.

#### 4. Special Considerations and Nuances

*   **Multi-Part Questions:** The difficulty increases with each required part. A 2-part question is inherently harder than a 1-part question. A 4-part question (e.g., naming Jesus's brothers) has a high cognitive load and should be scored accordingly (e.g., 600+).
*   **The "Citation Tax":** A question's difficulty is **significantly increased** if the *answer itself* is a Bible reference (e.g., "Which two verses..."). This tests precise textual location. However, a reference provided *in the question* for context does not increase difficulty.
*  **The Opacity Factor:** A question is harder if its wording is deliberately indirect, abstract, or descriptive rather than direct. The cognitive load increases if the contestant must first decipher the question itself before retrieving the answer.
*  **The Scattered Sources Multiplier:** A question requiring a multi-part answer or list is dramatically harder if the answers must be pulled from *separate, non-contiguous sections of the text* (e.g., different chapters or unrelated events).
*   **Red Herrings:** Contextual references to other parts of the Bible (e.g., "Fulfilling a prophecy in Numbers, Jesus...") do **not** increase a question's difficulty if the knowledge required to answer is found *only within the primary Gospel text*. The OT reference is merely framing, not required knowledge.
*   **Chronological Ordering:** The difficulty of "put these in order" questions depends entirely on the obscurity of the events. Ordering major life events is a 500-point task. Ordering less-famous parables or discourses is a 1000-point task.

#### More Nuances
**Question A:** "Who would recline at the table in the kingdom of heaven with the people in the east and the west?"  
**Question B:** "What would Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob do in the kingdom of heaven with the people in the east and the west?"

Let's break down the psychology of why Question B is superior.

##### Question A: The Direct Recall Question

-   **Cognitive Task:** This is a straightforward recall question. The contestant hears "Who..." and their brain immediately begins searching for a list of names associated with that scene.
    
-   **The Answer Path:** They access the memory of Matthew 8:11 (or Luke 13:28) and retrieve the answer directly from the text: "...recline at table with **Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob**..."
    
-   **Difficulty:** This is a solid question, probably worth 200-300 points. It tests whether someone knows that specific passage.
    

##### Question B: The Misdirection Question

-   **Cognitive Task:** This question is a subtle but powerful piece of misdirection. It gives away the hard part of Question A (the names of the patriarchs) for free. This makes the contestant feel like they have a head start, but it's a trap.
    
-   **The Psychological Trap:** By foregrounding "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," the question primes the contestant's brain to think about the people. But the question asks for the action ("What would they do?"). The famous names become a red herring that distracts from the true target of the question.
    
-   **The Answer Path:** The contestant must consciously ignore the famous names they just heard and instead focus on the verb associated with them in the passage. They must find the phrase **"recline at table"** (or a close synonym like "feast" or "dine"). This requires a higher level of mental discipline.
    
-   **Difficulty:** This is a much harder question, worth 400-500 points. It's no longer just testing recall; it's testing:
    
    1.  **Auditory Discipline:** Can you ignore the enticing proper nouns and focus on the verb?
        
    2.  **Textual Precision:** You're not looking for a name, but for a specific action. The answer format is less common and harder to retrieve under pressure.
        
    3.  **Resistance to Inference:** A contestant might be tempted to answer with a theological inference like "welcome them" or "be with them." But the question demands the specific, textual action: reclining at a meal.
        

##### Analogy: The Movie Scene

-   **Question A is like asking:** "Who are the three famous actors in this scene?" (Easy: You just name the stars.)
    
-   **Question B is like asking:** "In the scene with those three famous actors, what specific thing are they doing in the background?" (Harder: You have to look past the famous faces and notice they are, for example, playing cards or loading a ship.)
